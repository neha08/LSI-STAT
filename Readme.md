# LSI-STAT: A spatio-temporal analytical toolkit
## Master's Thesis (International Institute of Information Technology)

<span style="text-align: justify"> Geovisualization or geographic visualization makes patterns become apparent which otherwise would not have been deciphered. It prompts users into thinking and developing new hypothesis which leads them to make better decisions based on the visualization. </span> <br>

<span style="text-align: justify"> Today, a large variety of geovisualization tools are available. Each of these have a different set of features. Different combinations of these features exist in various tools. Along with this, it is also important to understand other aspects such as whether the tool is map-based or graph-based, whether is open source or proprietary, what kind of data input format they have, whether it is interactive or not among others. </span> <br>

<span style="text-align: justify"> This work involves the design and development of LSI-STAT, a web-based spatio-temporal interactive analytical platform. It is a visualization platform which captures both spatial and temporal trends in map along with neighborhood. It is a SOLAP platform which extends the OLAP capabilities to Spatial. It provides user with some basic querying capabilities based on OLAP principle. The platform models on user-given data. It computes data aggregation over ﬁeld names based on hierarchy. This hierarchy is user-deﬁned. It enables users to do an in-depth visual analysis of data to  discover hidden insights and patterns in data. The developed platform allows user to select multiple data attributes and generate chart for geovisualization. </span>

<span style="text-align: justify"> To demonstrate the utility and functionalities of the developed tool and to provide for a good understanding of the value that it provides, two case studies have been done (on health and sales data). </span> <br>
